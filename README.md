## Hi! I'm Ben Daniel. It's nice to meet you. üëã

## About Me üòé

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web applications. My expertise lies in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with a strong understanding of front-end development principles and responsive design. I love using React, Nextjs and Vue to build dynamic user interfaces and efficiently manage state, and I've worked on projects ranging from small to large-scale applications.

I also have experience with React Native, extending my skill set to mobile app development, ensuring users enjoy a seamless experience across web and mobile platforms. Currently, I'm learning Node.js to further expand my full-stack capabilities, as well as deepening my expertise in React Native for mobile development.

In addition to my front-end work, I have a growing interest in Web3 and Solidity for developing decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain. Exploring blockchain technology and creating smart contracts is a field I'm eager to dive deeper into.

I'm skilled at combining HTML and CSS to create visually appealing layouts and focused on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I'm proficient in version control systems like Git and prioritize collaboration and teamwork in my projects.

If you're looking for a front-end developer with expertise in React, Vue, React Native, and an interest in Web3 technologies like Solidity, and Node.js, let‚Äôs collaborate and build something amazing!
